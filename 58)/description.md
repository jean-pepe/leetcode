# 58. Length of Last Word

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

 

Example 1:

_Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9_

_Output: [0,1]_

Example 2:

_Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6_

_Output: [1,2]_

Example 3:

_Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6_

_Output: [0,1]_




Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

Example 1:

_Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5_


_Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4_


_Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6_
